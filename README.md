This project is still a work in progress and will likely not play well with other mods. I am uploading this hoping to get feedback and identify some bugs as I continue development. If you would like to contribute, I have provided a github link below.

This is my first mod submission, and there is definitely some messy code, so I welcome all kinds of input.

I hope others are as excited as I am to see this great game get multi-threading support!

NOTE: The number of threads to utilize should be set in the mod settings, according to your specific computer's core count.

LOAD ORDER:
The long answer is that this code replaces many of the game's built in methods using Harmony "prefix" (for modders out there). I know this has made some other modders not happy about how I did this. Maybe there is a better way I should have done this? maybe a transpiler? I don't exactly know what I'm doing - being the first mod and all.

That being said, since it replaces methods, I *think* towards the top? Someone please correct me if they have had better luck using a different mod order. I am actually only testing this with vanilla+royalty+tickspersecond right now, so I am probably not the best person to ask. I'll update this description as people reply with different experiences.
